# Conclude from the dataset

The dataset contains the body mass index (BMI) of 1786 people, together with the number of steps each of them took on a particular day, in two files: one for men, one for women.

Hypotheses:
1. there is a statistically significant difference in the average number of steps taken by men and women,
2. there is a negative correlation between the number of steps and the BMI for women
3. there is a positive correlation between the number of steps and the BMI for for men.

Using the dataset and the hypotheses as above, what do you conclude from the dataset? Do your findings from the dataset support these hypotheses? Is there any anomalies? Please report your findings.



The average number of steps taken by men = 8013.907514450867

The average number of steps taken by women= 6891.236699239957

Noticeable and anomalous situation in the dataset, if we show the step numbers on the x-axis and the BMI on the y-axis of a scatter plot, then you see an image of a gorilla waving to you.
